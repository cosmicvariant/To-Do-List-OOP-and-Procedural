# To-Do-List-OOP-and-Procedural
Design a to do list application. Create a Task class with attributes like task name, due date, and status (completed or not). Implement methods in the Task class to mark tasks as completed. In the procedural part, create a program that allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, list tasks, and remove completed tasks.
